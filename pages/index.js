          We hope you will see we are not your ordinary traditional church. We
          don't care what you are wearing, how many tattoos you have, or even
          what political party you support. But we do care about you! We are not
          perfect people, we are all broken in some way and coming to know
          Jesus. You don't have to know a secret handshake or any religious
          rituals to join our service. We just study the bible line-by-line,
          verse-by-verse, in a way anyone can understand. We want something for
          you, not something from you. We hope you will call this your home,
          become part of our family, and join our mission!

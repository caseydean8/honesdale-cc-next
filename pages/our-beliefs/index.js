              Spirit of God to write the very words of Scripture. Therefore, we believe the Bible is
              without error.'

          title='About God'
          text='We believe in one God who exists in three distinct persons: Father, Son and Holy
              Spirit. We believe that Jesus is the second member of the Trinity (the Son of God) who
              became flesh to reveal God to humanity and to become the Savior of the lost world.'

        <Card
          title='About Humanity'
          text='We believe all people were created in the image of God to have fellowship with him but
              became alienated in that relationship through sinful disobedience. As a result, people
              are incapable of regaining a right relationship with God through their own efforts.'

          title='About Salvation'
          text='We believe that the blood of Jesus Christ, shed on the cross, provides the sole basis
              for the forgiveness of sin. Therefore, God freely offers salvation to those who place
              their faith in the death and resurrection of Christ as sufficient payment for their
              sin.'

          title='About Christian Life'
          text='We believe all Christians should live for Christ and not for themselves. By obedience
              to the Word of God and daily yielding to the Spirit of God, every believer should
              mature and be conformed to the image of Christ.'

        <Card
          title='About the Church'
          text='â€‹We believe that the church is the body of Christ, of which Christ is the head. The
              members of the church are those who have trusted by faith in the finished work of
              Christ. The purpose of the church is to glorify God by loving him and making him known
              to the lost world.'
